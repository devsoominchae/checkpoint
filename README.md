## Introduction

This python code zips a file in a certain location and sends it through SFTP to another device. I used it to organize the code I need to update on locations that does not have Internet connection. Sort of an automation script.

## Usage

You can easily configure the config file for your purpose since it has intuitive names. The code is meant to run on Linux.
